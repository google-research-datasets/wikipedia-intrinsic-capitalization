# Wikipedia Intrinsic Capitalization Dataset

This is a corpus of sentences extracted from Wikipedia edit history with the sentence-initial words restored to their non-positional cases manually. For example, in "during the Soviet era...", the word "during" is in lowercase, while in "United will enter the Europa League at the group stage.", the word "United" is in uppercase, according to the rule of non-positional capitalization.
